# hive-broadcast-memory
This is a broadcast transport for [hive.js](http://hivejs.org). It is a dummy implementation and only useful if you only have one worker. If you need more than one worker, they will need the `broadcast` provider to communicate, thus you should use a real broadcast transport, like [broadcast-smokesignal](https://github.com/hivejs/hive-broadcast-smokesignal).
